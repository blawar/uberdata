TODO

1.0

James:
Planned for 1.0
Overdwell broken

Both:
Range check EVERYTHING.

Might be non-issues
- Figure out CRC issue (waiting on TS to handle celsius correctly)
- (BUG)Review Wes' high rpm sync loss
- Investigate noise filters relating to issues Wes spotted (not sure now)
- Remove unused bytes from outpc

Done:
- Investigate "feature3" still controlling injector sequence, but no ini settings
- IAT should be ignored with MAF only
- PID idle after crank not doing anything when RPM > open RPM?

on the fly?

- MAP accel triggers when set to 100% TPS? (unable to reproduce)
- Add MAP PID lockout adder to AC idleup.
- Add idle fuel table.
- Add an idle mode to ITB mode so that people without much vacuum on idle
won't get switched to alpha-n when the throttle is closed.
- Fix semi-seq on standard outputs. (Caveat: some configs that don't make sense
                                     are now config errors)

- VSS (Gear) dependant boost
- Water/meth injection
- Add new staging duty mode

- Ensure "time after spark" is working (appears ok, need KG confirmation)
- Investigate PW difference between MS2 and MS3
(JSM investigated at one set point. 36-1 V8 w/s, 2 alt, 8 inj, RF=10, CLT=102C, MAT=23C, Fuelload=102.8% VE1=92.9%
EGO disabled, BattV=12.9V. Getting over 100us jitter with "steady state" inputs.
 Approx 30us 0.3% difference noted, but range of PW jitter overlapped between MS2 + MS3. )

- Check spark trim mapping correct (it is)
- (BUG)AFR2 ADC12 input? (Fixed then immediately deleted!)

  a specific load/throttle position.

- Variable software PWM frequencies for boost/idle etc
- Use keyboard interrupts on select VSS inputs
