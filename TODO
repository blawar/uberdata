TODO for:

1.1

Awaiting more info from users:
- 36-2-2-2 V6 application

Coded awaiting testing or incomplete:
- When closed loop idle is enabled, make Idle Timing RPM correction optionally
  depend on that instead of the normal conditions for coming on. 
- Understand/fix internal-knock "weird readings when cold" - (init validation added)
- Audi flywheel mode (James, P2 - awaiting more testing)
- Nissan CAS, Optispark mode (James, P2 - new code awaiting more testing)
- NGC 6cyl cam sync - decoder done, but waiting on phasing data (James, P7)
- More tri-tach options if possible
- GM7X seq testing / re-write decoder (part done)
- Chrysler 2.2/2.5 sync/misfire issue (part done - on hold)

1.2 (some of these will get pushed back to 1.3)

1.2 Ken items
(done)

1.2 James items
(done)

Completed:
- Resolve duplication of "TPS accel" and "TPSaccel" outpc.tpsaccel and outpc.tps_accel (Ken) (Nothing to do for this. I created my own variables b/c I wanted
	      mine in %, but the standard algorithm expects and outputs in
	      milliseconds, so they're incompatible).
- Allow MAP logging to report a full cycle at low rpms
- Make MAF 'correction' table more sensible.
- Merge MAF calibration and correction
- Merge built-in baro curve with correction
- Review/rename menus and datalog fields for consistency and intuitive naming (mostly)
- Test mode to use new TS buttons feature
- Maximum VSS in launch
- Overdwell - regular spark
- Overdwell - rotary trailing
- Twin trigger - allow 2 stroke
- 'k' command for flash calibration tables too
- Twin trigger - allow "twin-trigger cam"
- TC perfect run rpm (coded but untested)
- TC include boost control (coded but untested)
- Status bytes to report input and output ports/pins.
- Make old AE in 0.01s units instead of 0.1s. Allow ignition events as an option.
- Monitor AFR for sane values and movement. Turn off EGOcor if out of range or stuck.
- Similar monitoring for other sensors.
- Check engine light
- Table blending / algo blending
- Phase sensing by MAP sensor (tested on engine)
- Cranking PW% curve blending (for flex)
- Consider MAFflow lookup - MS2/BG code uses an unsignedX flag on intrp1dc but that's not present in MS2 or MS3.
- Make loader look for ms3pro.s19 as well

1.3
- EGO backpressure correction table/curve.
- WUE vs. RPM (if required?)
- Transient timing?
- Baro from WOT?
- Inj dead time test mode. Swaps from seq to two pulses in quick succession (to maintain inj timing) (James, P8)
- Nissan V8 mode
- Consider more Nissan CAS modes
- Mazda6 2.3 VVT (James, P7)
- Make outpc variable size and allow TS to select what goes in.
- Firmware loader just sits there waiting for reply if e0 00 3e gets gobbled up (does timeout, but takes too long)
- Mini Siamese injection (James and Ken, P10 if at all)
- Air temp correction - new method? (what new method?) (James/Ken P4)
- Use can_t()
- Handle BMW extra-complicated VANOS
- MAF burnoff
- Double MAF range.

1.3 Ken items
- Idle enhancements. Replace min/max RPM settings with single input sensitivity
  setting.  Refine/simplify PID engagement settings if possible. (Ken, P1)
- Make CL stepper idle relative instead of adding to an absolute number. This
  way if steps are lost, it doesn't matter. Should make moving only work
  better.
- Boost control changes to make it spool faster and more accurately. (Ken)
- Fuel cut changes based on RPMdot for bringing fuel back on. (Ken)
- S5/FD RX7 OMP support. (Ken)
- Pot based boost... dial it up or down. (Ken, P5)
- Alternator Control (Ken)
- EGO looptime table with sensor delay setting.

1.3 James items
- SDcard readback code needs timeout and reset. (already there but not working as expected?)
- Race profiles (can include boost) to alter launch, nitrous, boost per user input.
- Respond to EGT per channel (James, P8)
- Long term trim in DFLASH
    - Added flash mechanism with redundant sectors (James)
    - Populate RAM trim table (James/Ken) 
- Spark/fuel cut/retard per Wes' suggestions
- Andy/James AE ideas (partial)
- Fuel pressure sensor calc (to monitor relative pressure)
- Oil pressure? (or leave to hardware?)
- Continue to extend CEL / limp-leonard modes
- Fuel temperature (more than LPG)
- AE type event at end of Overrun fuel cut
- Convert other software PWMs to new method.

2.0
- New ReqFuel
- Rewrite MAF - (really?)
- Ensure CAN timeout and reset behave correctly. (might skip this one)
- Idle speed control enhancements (separate algorithm from output, add
  more model-based valve control, CL advance based speed control, etc..) (Ken)
- Add angle clock (Ken)
- Rudimentary pre-emptive multitasking (Ken)
- Alpha-Beta-Gamma
- Lambda

For review:
- Monitor/graph 'trigger' time to monitor power per cylinder. ( 
- Smooth return from over-run fuel cut using retarded timing 0deg ----> normal
  Change this to: Anything we can do to smooth engagement and disengagement of
  overrun.
- Gear/speed related timing
- Better dual fuel support.
- Multi-spark
- Boost limited by CLT
- Baro based timing adjustment
- SD card format utility
- "Capture" mode to monitor and capture PW, spark timing, inj timing, VVT timing from engine running on other ECU
