TODO

1.1
Done:
- Make sure that the new dashpot works with the initial value table in
  idle code. (Ken)
- Make Idle Timing RPM correction work without closed loop idle
  being enabled. (Ken) (done)
- Timing-based idle speed control options.
- Make dashpot close quickly when RPMdot is not very negative, slower when it
  is very negative.
- First stab at new "accel-pump" style AE. (Done)
- Refine VVT if necessary (James and Ken, P10)
  - Log from y8s looks good. PID is done. Just bug fixes now.
- AC turning on fan should be optional (Ken, P5)
- CLT-based boost control operation (turn it on above a CLT, below which
  wastegate is held open). (Ken, P5)
- Add code to CL EGO to ignore extremely rich or lean values. (Ken, P5)
- Fix PID D term
- Add target increase option for fan control and AC idleup.
- Finish rewrite of mariob's additions to ms2 idle code
- finish VVT x 100 storage of previous value for precision reasons
- Enhanced config error reporting. Use pPTMpin[x] to store feature number and report conflicting pin
in user-friendly name. e.g. "Nitrous pin conflict on 'Nitrous in' with Datalogging."
- Rotary mode.
- Closed-loop VVT (Continuously variable)
- Create "Rotary mode" to support up to 4-rotor engines
- Traction control (not Patrick's MS2 code)
- 3.7 and 4.0 Jeep trigger wheels
- Verify > 3000rpm sync (from reset) on 60-2 (e.g. powercycle the stim)
- MAP input conflict reports Flex
- Anti-lag
- Add VSS options for idle advance and VE
- Toyota Multiplex ignition.
- VSS out option in pulses per mile
- VVT angle out of range tolerance and disabling
- Make all VVT values 0.1% in logs, and make hold duty setting 0.1%
- MAP sampling - ensure angle fits within tach event (James, P1)
- MAF to use SI units (James, P5)
- Flex input to capture fuel temperature too (James, P7) (bench tested only)
- Frequency based MAF sensors (James, P8)
- Frequency based MAP sensors (e.g. Cosworth?) (James, P8)
- New comms protocol. (in process) (James, P1)
-- Megaview compatability, SDcard newserial
-- Get rid of txbuf
- ST170 VVT decoder (James, P2)
- Knock windows (James, P1)
- Fuel consumption calcs in firmware (James, P8)
- Allow config error on generic sensors to be disabled
- 2JZ VVTi (James, P7)
- Honda wheel decoder D17A2 / Acura TSX
- Add Min TPS change and Min MAP change to trigger accel.
- fuel temp outpc. flex %
- support 'A' serial command again
- Fixup CAN passthrough (James, P1)
- fully implement semaphores around any port changes - fan and AC are unsafe
- Eliminate "use cam sensor" setting if possible. (P1)
- half-sync / full-sync indicator
- 1 cyl allow wasted spark like in MS2/Extra
- dual MAP sensors
- TFI signature PIP (James, P7)
- NGC 4cyl cam sync stability? (James, P3)
- Make launch indicator work as user expects. Revisit all indicator colours.
- Review "indicators" on TS dash. Consider all i/o ports. (considered them and decided not to presently)
- Re-do tpsdot and mapdot calcs. Original really crude noisy calc still in place !
- Optionally replace previously good duty with table-based duty based on
  target vs MAT.
- Review VSS1 vs VSS2 traction control
- SD improvements made, pending more testing.
- Forward on "set clock" to Extender (James)
- Add TPS/load thresholds to T/C. (James)
- VVT allow cams 2,3,4 when not in "trigger wheel"
- Knock, indicator > thresh only. Add CLT curve.
- Knock values are rolling average
- Dedicated knock outputs in outpc
- Incorporate std-CAN broadcasting
- Add accel pump new vars to ini (forgot at some point)
- 'teg' issue in firmware loader - i.e. doesn't work correctly if you specify a com port.
- new-AE overflow to 65ms as per http://www.msextra.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=125&t=44509&p=316810#p316810
- ALS Remove min TPS setting.
- new-AE in 0.1% units
- Nullify incorrect built-in MS2/BG tooltips
- Consider anti-lag enhancements (cyclic idle???) 
- Mario 4sq -> 8inj outputs bug
- Loop SDcard logfiles. (i.e. replace oldest when directory is full.)
- Nullify unused flash areas per Phil.
- Find out why enabling rotary hangs CPU
- SD/RTC wait a bit if date/time not yet valid.
- Optionally allow MAT correction with MAF
- Prime pulse delay.
- Fanctl on/off thresholds
- LS1 mis-sync testing
- TPS average window
- Before release - clean up ini, removing trial dialogues for new TS features
- After branch, before release - remove long-term-trim
- Viper V10 wheel mode (needs testing)
